<p>Call it my naivety or ignorance, but I was unaware of some pretty basic things about our mother earth. 
In 2018, I went to Saudi Arabia in Ramadan and was so surprised to see that the duration of a fast was shorter than Lahore. It was 
further suprising for me to see that there was some gap between the fast length between Makkah and Medina cities too.</p>

<p>Uptil then, I knew that there is a gap of x minutes between Lahore and other cities of the country, but used to think it is uniform (i.e. same difference in the sunset and sunrise timings).</p>

<p>It was first ever travel to another country. Then, I didn’t travel until 2022 and it was again Saudi Arabia. I didn’t notice the gaps as it was non-Ramadan so I didn’t think much about it. But when I came back, 
I was quite amazed to see that the same sun which was setting around 5:40PM there is setting here around 30 mins earlier.</p>

<p>Again, I didn’t explore much about it and comes April 2023 when I am set to fly to Kigali for a conference. I got curious to see 
what are their sunset/sunrise timings (purely for prayer timings) and got astonished to see that their day length never goes beyond the narrow range of 10 mins either side of the 12 hours day.</p>

<p>It almost set my mind on fire as I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Wow, equator has 12 hours day/night and poles can have 0/24 hours. As a result, visiting timeanddate.com became a norm for me.</p>

<p>Seeing sun’s angle and day’s duration has since then become a hobby for me.</p>

<p>This equinox led me to learn about new things, like equilux. Its so amazing to see that Svalbard has 15 minutes gap between each consecutive day currently and as a result, 14 hours day on 15th of September will reduce to no light at the end of October. Now, this is stunning and marvellous display of Allah’s creation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kigali has mere 6 seconds gap between the consecutive days currently. (Mind you, equinox is the time when changes are faster than the whole year).</p>

<p>While these facts are a testament to my ignorance and earth’s tilted travel around the sun, there are some even more interesting things.</p>

<p>For example, whole Nepal and Bhutan (including the Mount Everest) have lesser distance to equator than Lahore. Lahore is blazing hot, while Nepal and Bhutan are cold overall.</p>

<p>Here are some more facts I realized:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lahore and Gaza are on the same distance from equator (hence same day lengths on any given day), but Gaza is colder than Lahore.</li>
  <li>The most surprising thing I have noticed so far is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puncak_Jaya">Puncak Jaya</a> - a mountain which is almost on the equator. And that’s not the only one. If you see, you will find a cascade of mountains in this region.</li>
  <li>Arica (13 hours day in Dec) and Valdivia (15 hours day in Dec) are probably the widest cities of the same country (in terms of day lengths).</li>
</ul>

<p>Soon I will add more. Right now, I was just testing if this blog thing works :)</p>
